# Graphs Datasets

A collection of datasets with an underlying graph structure.
Some of these datasets contain a single graph, that can be accessed
with `dataset[]` or `dataset[1]`. Others contain many graphs, 
accessed through `dataset[i]`. Graphs are represented by the [`MLDatasets.Graph`](@ref) type.
